## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My app will track the expiration dates of makeup to make sure the user is not putting themselves at risk of exposure to
bacteria growth, which isn't good for the skin or body. Makeup users will find it useful to know when they should toss things
out to avoid that risk. Rarely do the makeup packages have expiration dates on them. I got this idea after reading an article 
about when to throw out makeup items after a certain time frame. I realized I have a hard time tracking when I first open 
a product, let alone know when I need to toss it out. That's why I wanted to create an app for it.
### Features
User login: Users will be able to create their own personal account and login to their makeup list.

Add makeup item: User will be able to add an item to their list with the date of when it was opened.

Delete makeup item: User will be able to delete an item off their list once they are notified that it has expired.
